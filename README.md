uastbench - a novel ukrainian language benchmark, using a mix of the LLM-as-a-judge approach and languagetool.org, aiming to provide the first comprehensive linguistic LLM benchmark for the ukrainian language by evaluating models on four self-explanatory categories: _spell_, _grmmr_, _prmpt_ and _fluent_. further detail in an incoming paper; automation code coming soon; results over at int3rrobang.github.io/uastbench/ (beware: judge on the website - claude-3-haiku, seems to be decent but you might wanna evaluate it yourself with a better model)
